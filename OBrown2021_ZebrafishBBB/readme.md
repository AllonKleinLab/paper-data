### Description of the Jupyter notebooks:
- STEP1_Filter_Dataset.ipynb: Annotation of the full single-cell dataset for both the WT and hm41 mutant genotypes. Filter out non-neuronal cell types.
- STEP2_Full_Dataset_Plots.ipynb: Visualize marker genes in the filtered single-cell dataset. Perform differential gene-expression (DGE) analysis for WT ahd hm41 genotypes.
- STEP3_Subcluster_Vasculature: Further filter the data to analyze cells in the vasculature
- STEP4_Vasculature_Plots: Plot Endothelial and Pericyte marker genes in the vasculature. Perform vasculature-specific DGE analysis.
