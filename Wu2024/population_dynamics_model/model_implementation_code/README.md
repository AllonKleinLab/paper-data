Model was defined as the class Simulation.

Implementation of the model was done in two formats: simulation of the behaviors in response to different hypoxic events and simulation of behaviors in response to different mechanisms of Epo and IL-17 action.

The code is organized into notebooks for a specific figure. Figure numbers may have changed in the editorial and revision process.
