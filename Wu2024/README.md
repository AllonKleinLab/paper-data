This repository contains code and relevant auxiliary files for the paper "IL-17A primes an early progenitor compartment to tune the erythropoietic feedback circuit" by Qiu Chang Wu, Aishwarya Swaminathan, Ashley Winward, Logan Lalonde, Yung Hwang, Noah Littman, Merav Socolovsky, and Allon Moshe Klein


This folder contains:
1. Code for applying generalize linear models to analyze the contribution of the stimulations to the differentially expressed genes in erythroid progenitors.
2. Code for implementing the population dynamics model to understand and gleam at a population dynamics mechanism by which IL-17 and Epo synergizes.
