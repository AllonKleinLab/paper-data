The scripts in this folder were used to run Cellsnp-lite and Vireo for genotype demultiplexing.

The following are bash scripts which were runn on the HMS O2 computing cluster:
- `run_cellsnp-lite.sh` was used to run Cellsnp-lite for the April 2022 library.
- `run_cellsnp-lite_1_SNPcalling.sh` were together used to run Cellsnp-lite for both May 2023 libraries.
    - `run_cellsnp-lite_1_SNPcalling.sh` discovers variable SNPs across the dataset.
    - `run_cellsnp-lite_2_genotyping.sh` uses the SNPs generated by the previous script to genotype cells.
    - Running these two scripts is the equivalent of running `run_cellsnp-lite.sh`, but uses less memory.
- `run_vireo.sh` was used to run Vireo for all libraries.

The following are python3 scripts:
- `genotype_barcodes_allowlist.py` generates a list of barcodes to allowlist, necessary for running cellSNP-lite.
- `reassignments_for_april2022.py` reassigns the animal labels for cells in the April 2022 dataset. Plots in Supplementary Fig. 1a-c are generated in this script.
- `donor_matching_between_libraries.py` generates the plot in Supplementary Fig. 1d to identify which SNP profile corresponds to the animal that contributed cells to both May 2023 libraries.
