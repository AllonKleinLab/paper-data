The scripts in this folder were used to run XXXX. See methods section "XXXX".

The files are:
- `gs_plots_Hs_vs_Cr.py` is the python script that both makes GS plots and calculates Jaccard similarity scores for the human vs. _C. robusta_ comparison. The script outputs a folder `gs_plots_Hs_vs_Cr_output/` containing XXX.
- `XXX_env.txt` contains information on the conda environment used, saved to a text file (by running `conda list --explicit > XXX_env.txt`).

Note that the functions for actually making the GS plots are in the helper_functions folder: `Scully_Ciona_blood_2025/helper_functions/gs_plot_helper_functions.py`. These functions are imported by the `XXX.py` scripts.
