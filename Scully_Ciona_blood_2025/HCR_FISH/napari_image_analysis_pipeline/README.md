The scripts in this folder were used to run XXXX. See methods section "XXXX".

The files are:
- `XXX.py` is the python script that performs GO analysis. The script outputs a folder `XXX_output/` containing tsv files with results from Fisher's exact test of GO term enrichment for each cell state's enriched DEGs.
- `XXX_env.txt` contains information on the conda environment used, saved to a text file (by running `conda list --explicit > XXX_env.txt`).
